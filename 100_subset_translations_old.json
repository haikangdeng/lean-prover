        "NL_problem_statement": "We consider a set G equipped with a binary operation (that is, a magma). Two equations involving this operation are defined as follows:\n\n• Equation3171 states that for every choice of four elements w, x, y, and z in G, the element x is equal to the result of first combining y with itself, then combining that result with z, then combining that result with w, and finally combining that with x.\n\n• Equation1121 states that for every choice of three elements x, y, and z in G, the element x is equal to the result of combining y with the element obtained by first combining y with the element obtained by combining y with x, and then combining that result with z.\n\nThe theorem claims that there exists some set G equipped with a binary operation (a magma) such that Equation3171 holds in G, while Equation1121 does not hold in G."
